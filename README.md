## A Dead Man's Switch

It seems like you've received a key from me and a URL directing to this page.  
Please follow the following guide to decrypt the files and recover the messages I've left for you:

## Step 1:
- Download this repository to your computer  
You can either clone this repository using `git clone https://github.com/f34rl00/deadswitch.git`  
or you can press the ```Code``` button on the github page and select ```Download ZIP``` to download the repository as a zip file, you should extract the zip file afterwards.
- Make sure all three files are available inside the directory you've downloaded  
- Make sure you have a copy of the file ```key.asc``` in case of any software errors

## Step 2:
- Open a terminal and ```cd``` to the ```deadswitch``` directory  
Then run ```python decrypt.py``` to decrypt the file.

- If you don't want to bother using a terminal, you can double-click the file ```decrypt.py``` to run it.

## Step 3:
- After running the file, you will see a prompt saying: ```Please provide the path of 'key.asc':```  
You should drop the path of ```key.asc``` inside the terminal or you can always manually write the ```absolute path``` of that file

## Step 4:
- After providing the path of ```key.asc``` you will see the decrypted file inside the directory.

## Step 5:
That's all.
